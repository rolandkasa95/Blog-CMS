After you cloned the project open a new cmd/terminal.

Go to your project, and write:
>>> vagrant up

After you've done this write this in the commandline:

>>> vagrant ssh

When that is done too copy the text inside of the mysql file, and simply paste 
it in the commandline.

Now your work is done, you can now use it.
